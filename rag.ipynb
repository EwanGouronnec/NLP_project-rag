While it\\'s not exclusively about a Viking, it features Russell Crowe as Robin Longstride, an English archer who fights alongside King Richard the Lionheart during the Crusades. The film has plenty of action-packed scenes and epic battles that might scratch your Viking itch.\\n\\nHowever, if you\\'re looking for a more traditional Viking movie experience, I\\'d suggest \"Alfred the Great\" (1969). This historical drama tells the story of Alfred, an English king who must navigate the complexities of war, politics, and personal relationships. The film features Michael York as Guthrum, a Viking leader, and explores themes of power, loyalty, and identity.\\n\\nBoth movies offer a unique take on the Viking era, but if you\\'re looking for something more action-oriented, \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" might be the better choice.'}"

In some translations, it is unclear whether Michel is condemning Patricia, or alternatively condemning the world in general.\\nAs Patricia and Detective Vital catch up with the dying Michel, they have the following dialogue:\\nMICHEL: C\\'est vraiment dégueulasse.\\nPATRICIA: Qu\\'est-ce qu\\'il a dit?\\nVITAL: Il a dit que vous êtes vraiment \"une dégueulasse\".\\nPATRICIA: Qu\\'est-ce que c\\'est \"dégueulasse\"?\\nIn the English captioning of the 2001 Fox-Lorber Region One DVD, \"dégueulasse\" is translated as \"scumbag\", producing the following dialogue:\\nMICHEL: It\\'s disgusting, really.\\nPATRICIA: What did he say?\\nVITAL: He said, \"You\\'re a real scumbag\".\\nPATRICIA: What\\'s a scumbag?\\nThe 2007 Criterion Collection Region One DVD uses a less literal translation:\\nMICHEL: Makes me want to puke.\\nPATRICIA: What did he say?'),\n",

The robbers run through Nottingham and put their horses into a stable. Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett), wife of Sir Robert Loxley, rouses her servants and demands that they open the gates.

       " 'answer': 'I\\'d recommend \"Alfred the Great\" as a good movie about an epic Viking, although it\\'s not exclusively about Vikings. The film is set in England during the 9th century and tells the story of Alfred, a young priest who becomes king after his brother\\'s death. While it doesn\\'t feature a traditional Viking hero, it does explore themes of leadership, power, and identity that might appeal to fans of epic Viking stories.\\n\\nHowever, if you\\'re looking for a more traditional Viking film, I\\'d suggest \"Alfred the Great\" is not the best fit. Instead, I\\'d recommend checking out other films like \"The 13th Warrior\" (1999) or \"Erik the Viking\" (1989), which feature epic Viking heroes and stories.\\n\\nBut if you\\'re open to a historical drama with some action and adventure elements, \"Alfred the Great\" is definitely worth watching. It\\'s a well-crafted film with strong performances from its cast, including Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett.'}"
