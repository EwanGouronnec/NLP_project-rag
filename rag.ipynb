       " 'answer': 'Based on your interest in an epic Viking movie, I\\'d recommend \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" (1991). While it\\'s not exclusively about a Viking, it features Russell Crowe as Robin Longstride, an English archer who fights alongside King Richard the Lionheart during the Crusades. The film has plenty of action-packed scenes and epic battles that might scratch your Viking itch.\\n\\nHowever, if you\\'re looking for a more traditional Viking movie experience, I\\'d suggest \"Alfred the Great\" (1969). This historical drama tells the story of Alfred, an English king who must navigate the complexities of war, politics, and personal relationships. The film features Michael York as Guthrum, a Viking leader, and explores themes of power, loyalty, and identity.\\n\\nBoth movies offer a unique take on the Viking era, but if you\\'re looking for something more action-oriented, \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" might be the better choice.'}"
